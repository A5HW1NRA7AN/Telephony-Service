# Setup Guide: GitHub Actions CI/CD with AWS ECR

This guide outlines the steps required to configure your GitHub repository and trigger the automated build, push, and remote SSH deployment pipeline.

---

## 1. Configure GitHub Secrets

Go to your repository on GitHub and navigate to Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions. Under the Secrets tab, click New repository secret to add the following credentials:

| Secret Name | Description / Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID** | The AWS IAM Access Key ID used by GitHub Actions to push images to ECR. |
| **AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY** | The corresponding AWS IAM Secret Access Key. |
| **SSH_PRIVATE_KEY** | The exact content of your private key PEM file (e.g., freeswitch-key.pem or asterisk-key.pem) used to authenticate SSH sessions. |

---

## 2. Configure GitHub Variables

Switch to the Variables tab (next to Secrets) and click New repository variable to configure the following non-sensitive inputs:

| Variable Name | Example / Target Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| **AWS_REGION** | ap-northeast-1 (or your target AWS region) |
| **BASTION_IP** | The public IP of your Bastion host (e.g., 52.69.97.143) |
| **PRIVATE_SERVER_IP** | The private IP of your backend server (e.g., 10.0.1.143) |
| **ECR_REPOSITORY_LEAD_SERVICE** | freeswitch-lead-service (for FreeSWITCH) or asterisk-lead-service (for Asterisk) |

## 3. How to Trigger a Deployment

The deployment pipeline is tag-based and will not run on normal branch pushes. To trigger a deployment:

1. Commit all your changes and push them to GitHub.
2. Create and push a git version tag with a prefix matching v*:

### For FreeSWITCH Stack:
```bash
# Tag the commit (use a tag containing 'freeswitch')
git tag v1.0.2-freeswitch

# Push the tag to GitHub to trigger the pipeline
git push origin v1.0.2-freeswitch
```

### For Asterisk Stack:
```bash
# Tag the commit (use a tag containing 'asterisk')
git tag v1.0.0-asterisk

# Push the tag to GitHub to trigger the pipeline
git push origin v1.0.0-asterisk
```

---

## 4. Monitoring the Run

Once the tag is pushed:
1. Navigate to the Actions tab of your repository on GitHub.
2. You will see a workflow run titled "Deploy Telephony Services to AWS" in progress.
3. You can click on the running job to watch real-time console logs of the Maven build, Docker compile, ECR push, and remote docker-compose refresh.
